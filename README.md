# ICT Skills 2 Assignment - Single Page app.

Name: Raymond Power

## Overview.

This is an App which displays a list of Movies which is being taken from The Movie Database API. From the HOME PAGE the user will see 20 of the most popular films on THE MOVIE DATABASE API at the current time. The user can view the Movie Poster, Title and Overview of the film on the main page and once logged in can click on the image to display a protected page which will give additional info.

The main page also allows the user to search by name and also filter by LANGUAGE of the film. The API only delivers movies in pages of 20 movies and I hope to add pagination at a later date to allow the user to view more titles. 

The user can also edit the name or overview information on the film and also use the delete movie function from the main page. Users can login initially or they will be redirected to the login page when they click on the movie image to view the full movie page.
